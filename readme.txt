== Description ==

[Blockons](https://blockons.com/go/website/)!!  WordPress Editor Blocks & Site Addons... It's free, it's customizable, and it's built for you!

Add powerful and advanced blocks to your website to enhance the WordPress editor (previously known as the Gutenberg editor), so you can easily create engaging and visually attractive website pages.

We currently have 14 editor blocks available at the moment (includes 3 WooCommerce blocks), but we're working on more... And we want to build gutenberg blocks that you need... We want to offer a complete blocks solution to building your website.


## Blockons Offers the following blocks

Use any of the following gutenberg blocks to build your website.

&#9989; **Search Bar / Icon** block
The Search Bar / Icon block was originally designed for Full Site Editing, to be added to the site header or footer, but the search icon block can be used as a normal search bar, and used anywhere on your website. It will add an editable search bar or an icon with a search bar drop down or popup for your site viewers to search for content on your website.

&#9989; **Line Heading** block
Our Line heading block is similar to the original heading block, but if offers a lot more customizations for the heading, and can also add lines to enhance the heading styling. The heading text and line is fully customizable to suit the style you're looking for.

&#9989; **Icon List** block
Use better icon list items to display on your website, a fully customizable list with your own icons simply makes your lists better to look at and is sure to be more attractive to the viewers eye.

&#9989; **Accordion(s)** block
Display content in a (click to) show or hide accordion style block... This is good for displaying lots of content in an expandable section or content such as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's) where your users can select and click for the content they want to see.

&#9989; **Advanced Image Gallery** block
Select from 3 beautiful layouts, to display your galleries, as well as image hover animations & caption display options:

**Default Grid layout** - Use the normal, neat grid type layout with lots of customization options for your image gallery.
**Masonry Gallery Layout** - Display your images in a neat masonry type layout which is sort of like a mason fitting stones in a wall, or like the Pinterest blocks layout
**Featured Grid Layout** - The Featured grid offers small and large images all neatly tiled together to create a beautiful gallery.

&#9989; **Image Comparison** block
The Image Comparison block allows you to display and compare the differences between two images side by side (or above and below each other), and view them by using an action slider to compare the images.

&#9989; **Marketing Button** block
Basically an advanced button block. The marketing button lets you add a stand out CTA (call-to-action) button with an icon, heading and text to attract your users to click through.

&#9989; **Progress Bars** block
Add animated progress bars to visually display percentage amounts on your website. Progress bars are fully customizable for you to change text, thickness and colors.

&#9989; **Testimonials Slider** block
Display customer star rated feedback or user comments in a neat testimonial slider or carousel block. Testimonials will help your viewers gain trust on your brand. Display an image, name, star rating and a comment about your work or products. Fully customizable with different layouts and custom colors.

&#9989; **Video Slider** block
Neatly display any Youtube, Vimeo or custom hosted Videos in a powerful video slider or carousel block. Customize the colors and cover image. The Videos will play when a user clicks on the slide they want to watch.

## Blockons Offers the following Site Add-ons

&#9989; **Website Page Loader**

&#9989; **Page Scroll Indicator**
Add a scroll progress bar to the top or bottom of your website pages which indicates to the website viewers how far they have scrolled, or how far they have left to scroll on the page. This gives users a visual indication of how far they are on the page which is useful when users are reading blog posts or long website pages.

&#9989; **Back To Top Button**
Add a customizable Back to Top button to your website to let users easily and quickly scroll back to the start of the page with one click.

= We're concerned about bloat code! =

Blockons blocks are built with the newest methods (and technologies) for building WordPress editor blocks...

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Blockons work with my theme?
Blockons should work with ALL themes! But as themes and plugins add their own CSS or Javascript which might affect any plugin from working perfectly... We're here to help... [Let us know](https://blockons.com/go/contact/) if something doesn't work and we'll help you fix it.

= Where are the Blockons settings?
The Blockons manager settings and Site Add-Ons are found in the WordPress Dashboard under Dashboard -> Settings -> Blockons Settings.

Blocks Settings - As you add each block you will be able to edit the block live within the WordPress editor. Some of the settings also have help links or hints on how to use them.

= I don't see the WooCommerce blocks?
For the WooCommerce blocks (Account Icon, Featured Products & Mini Cart) you need to have the WooCommerce plugin activated.

= Will Blockons work with other block plugins?
We've tested with lots of different gutenberg blocks plugins like CoBlocks, Ultimate Blocks, Spectra, GenerateBlocks, Otter page builder blocks & Gutenverse gutenberg blocks to name a few... Blockons should not affect or be affected by other blocks plugins or page builders.

= I don't see the same amount of blocks?
When we add new blocks, by default they are turned off... This is encase you've manually turned blocks off for site speed and loading.

We don't want to auto-turn them on, so you'll need to go to Dashboard -> Settings -> Blockons Settings -> Blocks and turn on the new blocks that you want to use.

You should receive a 'We've added new blocks' notice (which is dismissable) when we add new blocks.

= This block contains unexpected or invalid content
This is most likely from a latest update adding new settings to the block, and so WordPress displays this warning because the blocks editor version looks slightly different to the saved frontend version of the block.

Clicking "Attempt Block Recovery" should fix the block.

= I found a bug... What do I do?
Please [contact us](https://blockons.com/go/contact/) so we can post a fix and get it working for you.

= Something doesn't look right or is slightly out in the design?
This could be from the theme you're using, or another plugin. Again, please [contact us](https://blockons.com/go/contact/) so we can post a fix or give you custom CSS to fix it.
