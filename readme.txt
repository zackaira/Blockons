WordPress editor blocks for you to build your website.


== Description ==

[Blockons](https://blockons.com/go/website/)! It's free, it's customizable, and it's built for you!

Add powerful and advanced blocks to your website to enhance the WordPress editor (previously known as Gutenberg), so you can easily create engaging and visually attractive website pages.

We only have 12 blocks available at the moment, but we're working on more... And we want to build what the you need, to be able to build a complete website using 1 blocks plugin.


= Blockons Offers the following blocks =

&#9989; **Search Bar / Icon** block
The Search Bar / Icon block was originally designed for Full Site Editing, to be added to the site header or footer, but the search icon block can be used as a normal search bar, and used anywhere on your website. It will add an editable search bar or an icon with a search bar drop down or popup for your site viewers to search for content on your website.

&#9989; **Line Heading** block
Our Line heading block is similar to the original heading block, but if offers a lot more customizations for the heading, and can also add lines to enhance the heading styling. The heading text and line is fully customizable to suit the style you're looking for.

&#9989; **Icon List** block
Use better icon list items to display on your website, a fully customizable list with your own icons simply makes your lists better to look at and is sure to be more attractive to the viewers eye.

&#9989; **Accordion(s)** block
Display content in a (click to) show or hide accordion style block... This is good for displaying lots of content in an expandable section or content such as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's) where your users can select and click for the content they want to see.

&#9989; **Marketing Button** block
Basically an advanced button block. The marketing button lets you add a stand out CTA (call-to-action) button with an icon, heading and text to attract your users to click through.

&#9989; **Progress Bars** block
Add animated progress bars to visually display percentage amounts on your website. Progress bars are fully customizable for you to change text, thickness and colors.

&#9989; **Testimonials Slider** block
Display customer star rated feedback or user comments in a neat testimonial slider or carousel block. Testimonials will help your viewers gain trust on your brand. Display an image, name, star rating and a comment about your work or products. Fully customizable with different layouts and custom colors.

&#9989; **Video Slider** block
Neatly display any Youtube, Vimeo or custom hosted Videos in a powerful video slider or carousel block. Customize the colors and cover image. The Videos will play when a user clicks on the slide they want to watch.

&#9989; **Account Icon** WooCommerce block
Add a simple icon to your header or footer to let users quickly access their account or login to your website. Select from different account icons and change the colors as you like, and when the user is logged in, you can display quick links to the different WooCommerce account pages.

&#9989; **WooCommerce Mini Cart** block
Add a customizable WooCommerce cart to your site header or footer, or anywhere you like, with an optional drop down basket so your users can edit their cart, or simply Go to Cart and/or Checkout to complete their purchase. 

&#9989; **Featured Product** WooCommerce block

= Blockons Offers the following Site Add-ons =

&#9989; **Website Page Loader**
Display a neat loader while your images and page contents are loading... This prevents the website viewers seeing any broken layouts or images before they are loaded. Customize the loader background and colors to suit your website.

&#9989; **Page Scroll Indicator**
Add a scroll progress bar to the top or bottom of your website pages which indicates to the website viewers how far they have scrolled, or how far they have left to scroll on the page. This gives users a visual indication of how far they are on the page which is useful when users are reading blog posts or long website pages.

&#9989; **Back To Top Button**
Add a customizable Back to Top button to your website to let users easily and quickly scroll back to the start of the page with one click.

= Fast & Intuitive =

Blockons is built to be a fast & lightweight, and easy to work with, for building your WordPress and WooCommerce website.

Blockons is built with the latest methods and technologies for creating blocks for the WordPress block editor... It's built the WordPress way, so it's fast and offers very powerful and advanced blocks.

We'd even bet our editor blocks are a lot more customizable than other block plugins out there.


= We're concerned about bloat code! =

Blockons is built with the newest methods (and technologies) for building WordPress blocks... Meaning it doesn't have old deprecated ways of adding blocks like when the new WordPress editor first got added, it's reached an established way of building blocks, and that's the way we're doing it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Blockons work with my theme?
It should work with ALL themes! But as themes and plugins add their own CSS or Javascript which might affect any plugin from working perfectly... We're here to help... [Let us know](https://blockons.com/go/contact/) if something doesn't work and we'll help you fix it.

= Where are the Blockons settings?
The Blockons manager settings and Site Add-Ons are found in the WordPress Dashboard under Dashboard -> Settings -> Blockons Settings.

Blocks Settings - As you add each block you will be able to edit the block live within the WordPress editor. Some of the settings also have help links or hints on how to use them.

= I don't see the WooCommerce blocks?
For the WooCommerce blocks (Account Icon, Featured Products & Mini Cart) you need to have the WooCommerce plugin activated.

= I don't see the same amount of blocks?
When we add new blocks, by default they are turned off... This is encase you've manually turned blocks off for site speed and loading.

We don't want to auto-turn them on, so you'll need to go to Dashboard -> Settings -> Blockons Settings -> Blocks and turn on the new blocks that you want to use.

You should receive a 'We've added new blocks' notice (which is dismissable) when we add new blocks.

= I found a bug... What do I do?
Please [contact us](https://blockons.com/go/contact/) so we can post a fix and get it working for you.

= Something doesn't look right or is slightly out in the design?
This could be from the theme you're using, or another plugin. Again, please [contact us](https://blockons.com/go/contact/) so we can post a fix or give you custom CSS to fix it.
