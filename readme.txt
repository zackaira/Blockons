= Fast & Intuitive =

Blockons is built to be a fast & lightweight, and easy to work with, for building your WordPress and WooCommerce website.

Blockons is built with the latest methods and technologies for creating blocks for the block editor... It's built the WordPress way, so it's fast and offers very powerful and advanced blocks.

We'd even bet our editor blocks are a lot more customizable than other block plugins out there.


= We're concerned about bloat code! =

Blockons is built with the newest methods (and technologies) for building WordPress blocks... Meaning it doesn't have old deprecated ways of adding blocks like when the new WordPress editor first got added, it's reached an established way of building blocks, and that's the way we're doing it!

= I found a bug... What do I do?
Please [contact us](https://blockons.com/go/contact-us/) so we can post a fix and get it working for you.
