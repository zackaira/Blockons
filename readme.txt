## Blockons Offers the following Advanced Editor Blocks

Use any of the following gutenberg blocks to build your website, they all come with customizable settings to fit your website design.

&#9989; **Search Bar / Icon** block
You can add a search bar anywhere on your website, which allows visitors to easily search for and find information on your site.

This search feature provides a standard search bar design, with options to display only the icon, and to reveal the search bar through a hover-over effect or within a sleek popup lightbox. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/search-bar-or-search-icon-block/)

&#9989; **Line Heading** block
The line heading block is a tool that lets you create a title with decorative lines, making it more visually appealing. It also includes advanced options to customize how the title looks. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/line-heading-block/)

&#9989; **Advanced Slider** block
The Slider block transforms your page with a neat, easy-to-use slider where you can spotlight your favorite images & text, or display top-selling WooCommerce products. Slide through your visuals with just a click or a simple swipe, bringing your content to life. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/advanced-slider-block/)

&#9989; **Icon List** block
Improve your website by using customizable icon list items. Adding your own icons to lists not only makes them more visually appealing but also more attractive to your audience. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/icon-list-block/)

&#9989; **Mapbox Maps** block
The Mapbox Maps block seamlessly integrates interactive maps into your site, enabling visitors to explore locations and find your places with ease. Ideal for store locators, event venues, or travel routes, this block offers customizable map features for a more engaging user experience. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/maps-block/)

&#9989; **Tabs** block
The Tabs block organizes your content into a clean, streamlined format, making it easy for visitors to navigate through different sections without leaving the page. Perfect for FAQs, product descriptions, or service details, this block allows users to switch between tabs with just a click. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/tabs-block/)

&#9989; Dynamic **Content Selector** block
The Dynamic Content Selector block enhances user interaction by allowing visitors to select specific options from a dropdown menu. Upon selection, the corresponding content is dynamically displayed, ensuring a streamlined and interactive experience. This block is perfect for showcasing different sections without overwhelming the page and providing an organized way to present information. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/dynamic-content-selector-block/)

&#9989; **Content Toggler** block
The content toggler block helps organize your website by allowing you to hide and reveal large sections of content. Visitors can click on the toggler to view more details like text, images, or videos. This keeps your page neat and prevents clutter, making it great for detailed sections that you want available but not immediately visible. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/content-toggler-block/)

&#9989; **Contact Form** block
A contact form block lets visitors easily send you messages through your website. Rather than showing your email address, visitors can fill out a contact form that delivers their message straight to your inbox. You can customize what information you collect in the contact form - making it perfect for contact pages, support requests, or gathering any information from your website visitors.  [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/contact-form-block-for-wordpress/)

&#9989; **Accordion(s)** block
Show your content in a clickable accordion-style block, which is great for presenting a lot of information in an expandable area. This is especially useful for sections like Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), where visitors can choose and click to see the specific content they're interested in. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/accordion-block/)

&#9989; **Advanced Image Gallery** block
Choose from three attractive layouts for showcasing your galleries, complete with image hover animations and caption options:

**Default Grid layout** - This standard, organized grid layout provides numerous customization options for your image gallery.
**Masonry Gallery Layout** - Arrange your images in a masonry-style layout, similar to how a mason fits stones in a wall, or like the layout seen on Pinterest.
**Featured Grid Layout** - This layout mixes small and large images in a neat tiled pattern, creating a visually appealing gallery.
[See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/advanced-image-gallery-block/)

&#9989; **Image Carousel** block
The Image Carousel block allows you to showcase multiple images in a single, interactive carousel format. Users can navigate through the images by clicking on arrows on either side of the carousel or by using a swipe gesture on touch-enabled devices. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/image-carousel-block-or-image-slider/)

&#9989; **Image Comparison** block
The Image Comparison block lets you compare two images by placing them over each other and using a slider for a direct comparison. The slider can be dragged left or right, or up and down to compare the images. This block also includes further customzation options. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/image-comparison-block/)

&#9989; **Marketing Button** block
The marketing button is an advanced version of a standard button block. It enables you to create an eye-catching call-to-action (CTA) button, complete with an icon, a heading, and text, designed to draw in users and encourage them to click through. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/marketing-button-block/)

&#9989; **Countdown Timer** block
The Countdown Timer block adds excitement and urgency to your webpage by ticking away the seconds towards any special event or deadline you choose. Set it up in minutes to count down to sales, product launches, or the start of an eagerly awaited event. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/countdown-timer-block/)

&#9989; **Progress Bars** block
Place animated progress bars on your website to show percentage values in a visual way. You can fully customize these bars, including their text, thickness, and colors. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/progress-bars/)

&#9989; **Testimonials Slider** block
Showcase customer ratings and comments in a sleek testimonial slider or carousel. These testimonials can build trust in your brand by displaying images, names, star ratings, and comments about your work or products. You can customize it with various layouts and colors to fit your style. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/testimonials-block-slider-or-carousel/)

&#9989; **Video Slider** block
Showcase videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or your own hosting in an attractive video slider or carousel block. You can personalize it by changing the colors and setting a cover image. The videos will start playing when a user selects the slide they want to watch. [See Example](https://blockons.com/documentation/video-slider-block/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Blockons work with my theme?
Blockons should work with ALL themes! But as themes and plugins add their own CSS or Javascript which might affect any plugin from working perfectly... We're here to help... [Let us know](https://blockons.com/go/contact/) if something doesn't work and we'll help you fix it.

= Where are the Blockons settings?
The Blockons manager settings and Site Add-Ons are found in the WordPress Dashboard under Dashboard -> Settings -> Blockons Settings.

Blocks Settings - As you add each block you will be able to edit the block live within the WordPress editor. Some of the settings also have help links or hints on how to use them.

= I don't see the WooCommerce blocks?
For the WooCommerce blocks (Account Icon, Featured Products & Mini Cart) you need to have the WooCommerce plugin activated.

= Will Blockons work with other block plugins?
We've tested with lots of different gutenberg blocks plugins like CoBlocks, Ultimate Blocks, Spectra, GenerateBlocks, Otter page builder blocks & Gutenverse gutenberg blocks to name a few... Blockons should not affect or be affected by other blocks plugins or page builders.

= I don't see the same amount of blocks?
When we add new blocks, by default they are turned off... This is encase you've manually turned blocks off for site speed and loading.

We don't want to auto-turn them on, so you'll need to go to Dashboard -> Settings -> Blockons Settings -> Blocks and turn on the new blocks that you want to use.

You should receive a 'We've added new blocks' notice (which is dismissable) when we add new blocks.

= This block contains unexpected or invalid content
This is most likely from a latest update adding new settings to the block, and so WordPress displays this warning because the blocks editor version looks slightly different to the saved frontend version of the block.

Clicking "Attempt Block Recovery" should fix the block.

[Read more](https://blockons.com/documentation/how-to-recover-a-broken-block/) on block recovery here.

= I found a bug... What do I do?
Please [contact us](https://blockons.com/go/contact/) so we can post a fix and get it working for you.

= Something doesn't look right or is slightly out in the design?
This could be from the theme you're using, or another plugin. Again, please [contact us](https://blockons.com/go/contact/) so we can post a fix or give you custom CSS to fix it.
