== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Blockons work with my theme?
It should ! But as themes and plugins add their own CSS or Javascript which might affect Blockons from working perfectly... We're here to help... [Let us know](https://blockons.com/go/contact-us/) if something doesn't work and we'll help you fix it.

= Where are the Blockons settings?
As you add each block you will be able to edit the block live within the WordPress editor. Some of the settings also have help links or hints on how to use them.

= I found a bug... What do I do?
Please [contact us](https://blockons.com/go/contact-us/) so we can post a fix and get it working for you.

= Something doesn't look right or is slightly out in the design?
This could be from the theme you're using, or another plugin. Again, please [contact us](https://blockons.com/go/contact-us/) so we can post a fix or give you custom CSS to fix it.
